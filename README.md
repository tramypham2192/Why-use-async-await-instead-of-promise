# Why-use-async-await-instead-of-promise

Async await has the same functionality as promise, but the code is easier to look at.
In app.js file, announceDinner() follows async await syntax, and has the same functionality as nativePromiseDinner(). nativePromiseDinner() follows promise syntax.

Output of app.js file:
node app.js
I have to decide what's for dinner...
